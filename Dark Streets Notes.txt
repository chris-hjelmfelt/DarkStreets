To Do:
-- full power hits vs low power hits
    -- create a timer like in minecraft so spam clicking is less effective
    -- get more damage by switching between attack types (at least every two or three hits - avoid just a single attack type)
    -- ? also maybe two hitboxes (closer and further) - one low power, one high



Troubleshooting:
-- I had a bug where the enemy was rising into the sky when I push towards them (makng them move back)
    -- In the statements for trying to line up with the player I wasn't handling the player.x + barrier = enemy.x case
       I don't know why they were trying to move up when they were already in line, but that seems to have fixed it
-- player was moving around by itself when attacking
   -- I added:  playerArray[0].vx = player.vx;  and   playerArray[0].vy = player.vy;  to changePlayerStance()
