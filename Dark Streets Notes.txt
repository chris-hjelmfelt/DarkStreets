To Do:
-- fix bug where player moves around by itself when attacking
-- when one person is up and the other down, hits shouldn't work, remember the perspective, they are actually on the same level
    -- change hitbox heights
-- players head is dark grey
-- create a timer like in minecraft for full power hits vs low power hits
    -- also maybe two hitboxes- one low power, one high



Troubleshooting:
-- I had a bug where the enemy was rising into the sky when I push towards them (makng them move back)
    -- In the statements for trying to line up with the player I wasn't handling the player.x + barrier = enemy.x case
       I don't know why they were trying to move up when they were already in line, but that seems to have fixed it
-- player was moving around by itself when attacking
   -- I added:  playerArray[0].vx = player.vx;  and   playerArray[0].vy = player.vy;  to changePlayerStance()
